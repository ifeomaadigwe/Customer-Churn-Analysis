## Analysis

In this analysis, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the customer churn dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and factors influencing churn. The EDA includes visualizations and statistical analysis to answer key business questions and make informed decisions.

The main analyses performed on the dataset include:

1. Gender and Churn: Visualizing the churn rate by gender.
2. Contract and Churn: Analyzing the churn rate based on different contract types.
3. Payment Method and Churn: Exploring the influence of payment method on customer churn.
4. Tenure and Churn: Investigating the relationship between customer tenure and churn.
5. Internet Service and Churn: Analyzing the impact of internet service on customer churn.
6. Online Security and Churn: Investigating the effect of online security on customer churn.
7. Monthly Charges and Churn: Exploring the relationship between monthly charges and churn.
8. Recommendations: Providing recommendations based on the analysis findings.


### Recommendations: Based on the dataset made available, the company can improve customer retention and reduce churn rates by:

#### Contract Type: 
- Encourage customers to opt for longer-term contracts, such as one-year or two-year contracts, as they have lower churn rates compared to month-to-month contracts.

#### Payment Method: 
- Provide incentives or promotions for customers to use credit card or bank transfer (automatic) payment methods, as they have lower churn rates compared to electronic checks.

#### Technical Support: 
- Enhance the availability and quality of technical support services to reduce customer churn. Customers without technical support have a significantly higher churn rate.

#### Online Backup and Security: 
- Promote the use of online backup and security services to customers, as they have lower churn rates compared to customers without these services.

#### Internet Service: 
- Focus on improving the quality and reliability of fiber optic internet service to reduce churn among customers with this service. Encourage customers without internet service to explore options and benefits of having an internet connection.

#### Customer Engagement: 
- Implement proactive customer engagement strategies, such as personalized offers, loyalty programs, and regular communication, to build stronger relationships with customers and increase customer satisfaction.
